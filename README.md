## About Me
ðŸ”­ I'm working on: **MazOS** (my own operating system I am building from scratch)

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning: **how to integrate networking capabilities into my operating system**, focusing on protocols, socket programming and packet handling

ðŸ’» Fun Fact: **My introduction to programming was through Pascal**

## Project Showcase
### [âš¡ Accelerometer Sensor](https://github.com/angh-el/microcontroller-accelerometer-graphing-app)
This embedded system project uses the built-in accelerometer of the micro:bit micro-controller to measure movement and plot displacement on an external OLED display. As the micro:bit detects any changes in horizontal acceleration, the displacement is calculated and visualised in real time.
 
### [ðŸ“¸ PicStagram](https://github.com/angh-el/PicStagram)
PicStagram is a full-stack Instagram clone, built using the MERN stack. The app allows users to upload, like and comment on posts. Other features include user feeds, user profile pages and notifications pages.

### [ðŸ“® YouTube File Storage](https://github.com/angh-el/YouTubeFileStorage)
A proof of concept application that aims to use YouTube as an unconventional form of cloud storage. Conclusions of this project highlight the inefficiencies of this approach due to the video files being at least 3 times larger than the original file and the amount of time it takes to convert a file to video format, and vice versa. Additionally, this does not fully adhere to Google's terms of service. 

### [ðŸŽµ Assembly Note Player](https://github.com/angh-el/NotePlayer)
A small interactive game that allows users to play musical notes through key inputs and offers a graphical display of the notes being played. The application aims to strengthen my low level programming skills as the entire app is coded in MIPS assembly language.

### [ðŸ’Œ Messaging App](https://github.com/angh-el/MessagingApp)
A simple messaging app that allows multiple users to connect to a central server and communicate in real time.

### [ðŸ“Š Sorting Algorithm Visualiser](https://github.com/angh-el/SortingAlgorithmVisualisation)
A graphical visualisation tool for a handful of sorting algorithms. The application aims to strengthen my algorithmic implementation and Python programming skills.

### [ðŸŽ² Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/angh-el/SortingAlgorithmVisualisation)
A brute-force Sudoku solver that makes uses of back-tracking to find the solution to any solvable board.
