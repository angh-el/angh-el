## About Me
ðŸ”­ I'm working on: **MazOS** (my own operating system I am building from scratch)

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning: **how to integrate networking capabilities into my operating system**, focusing on protocols, socket programming and packet handling

ðŸ’» Fun Fact: **My introduction to programming was through Pascal**

## Project Showcase
### [ðŸ¦¾ MazOS - my own custom built from scratch operating system](https://github.com/angh-el/MazOS)
A 32-bit operating system for x86 processors. The os has its own custom kernel, efficient memory manager, and custom  process manager that supports adaptive scheduling. A range of drivers, including: PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard driver, ATA Disk driver, Sound Blaster 16 audio driver, VGA driver (and support for opening and rendering .png files), and fully functioning FAT32 filesystem and support for wide range of file operations  (open, read, write, close, create, delete, copy and paste). Some basic POSIX compliant system calls (write, read, sbrk, exit, execve, fork, open and kill). Intuitive command line interface and Unix-like commands (cd, ls, pwd, cat, rm, mk and touch) plus other custom commands for better usability, and some simple user-space applications showcasing the range of features os MazOS.

### [ðŸ“ˆ Trading Strategy Backtest Engine](https://github.com/angh-el/TradingStrategyBacktester)
A full-stack app for simulating algorithmic trading strategies using 1-minute OHLCV data. Features a hihgly optimised C++ backtesting engine, a range of technical indicators and interactive React interface that lets users select ticker and time ranges, and customise sample trading strategies. Additionally users are allowed to create their own trading strategies and test their successfullnes.

### [âš¡ Accelerometer Sensor](https://github.com/angh-el/microcontroller-accelerometer-graphing-app)
This embedded system project uses the built-in accelerometer of the micro:bit micro-controller to measure movement and plot displacement on an external OLED display. As the micro:bit detects any changes in horizontal acceleration, the displacement is calculated and visualised in real time.
 
### [ðŸ“¸ PicStagram](https://github.com/angh-el/PicStagram)
PicStagram is a full-stack Instagram clone, built using the MERN stack. The app allows users to upload, like and comment on posts. Other features include user feeds, user profile pages and notifications pages.

### [ðŸ“® YouTube File Storage](https://github.com/angh-el/YouTubeFileStorage)
A proof of concept application that aims to use YouTube as an unconventional form of cloud storage. Conclusions of this project highlight the inefficiencies of this approach due to the video files being at least 3 times larger than the original file and the amount of time it takes to convert a file to video format, and vice versa. Additionally, this does not fully adhere to Google's terms of service. 

### [ðŸŽµ Assembly Note Player](https://github.com/angh-el/NotePlayer)
A small interactive game that allows users to play musical notes through key inputs and offers a graphical display of the notes being played. The application aims to strengthen my low level programming skills as the entire app is coded in MIPS assembly language.

### [ðŸ’Œ Messaging App](https://github.com/angh-el/MessagingApp)
A simple messaging app that allows multiple users to connect to a central server and communicate in real time.

### [ðŸ“Š Sorting Algorithm Visualiser](https://github.com/angh-el/SortingAlgorithmVisualisation)
A graphical visualisation tool for a handful of sorting algorithms. The application aims to strengthen my algorithmic implementation and Python programming skills.

### [ðŸŽ² Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/angh-el/SortingAlgorithmVisualisation)
A brute-force Sudoku solver that makes uses of back-tracking to find the solution to any solvable board.
