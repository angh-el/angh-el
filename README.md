## About Me
🔭 I'm working on: **MazOS** (my own operating system I am building from scratch)

🌱 I'm currently learning: **how to integrate networking capabilities into my operating system**, focusing on protocols, socket programming and packet handling

💻 Fun Fact: **My introduction to programming was through Pascal**

## Project Showcase
### [🦾 MazOS - my own custom operating system](https://github.com/angh-el/MazOS)
A 32-bit operating system for x86 processors. The os has its own custom kernel, efficient memory manager, and custom  process manager that supports adaptive scheduling. A range of drivers, including: PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard driver, ATA Disk driver, Sound Blaster 16 audio driver, VGA driver (and support for opening and rendering .png files), and fully functioning FAT32 filesystem and support for wide range of file operations  (open, read, write, close, create, delete, copy and paste). Some basic POSIX compliant system calls (write, read, sbrk, exit, execve, fork, open and kill). Intuitive command line interface and Unix-like commands (cd, ls, pwd, cat, rm, mk and touch) plus other custom commands for better usability, and some simple user-space applications showcasing the range of features os MazOS.

### [🌊 LiqueDeFi ](https://github.com/angh-el/LiqueDeFi)
LiqueDeFi is a non-custodial crosschain routing protocol that automatically finds the cheapest and fastest way to transfer stablecoins across blockchains. Instead of forcing users to choose a bridge or worry about gas fees, LiqueDeFi analyses real time costs, liquidity, and protocol availability to select the optimal route, prioritising Circle’s CCTP for native USDC transfers when possible and falling back to Bridge Kit when needed. The result is a simple MetaMask based experience that reduces fees, improves reliability, and removes friction from crosschain stablecoin transfers.

### [📈 Trading Strategy Backtest Engine](https://github.com/angh-el/TradingStrategyBacktester)
A full-stack app for simulating algorithmic trading strategies using 1-minute OHLCV data. Features a highly optimised C++ backtesting engine, a range of technical indicators and interactive React interface that lets users select tickers and time ranges, and customise sample trading strategies. Additionally users can implement their own trading strategies and evaluate them.

### [⚡ Accelerometer Sensor](https://github.com/angh-el/microcontroller-accelerometer-graphing-app)
This embedded system project uses the built-in accelerometer of the micro:bit micro-controller to measure movement and plot displacement on an external OLED display. As the micro:bit detects any changes in horizontal acceleration, the displacement is calculated and visualised in real time.

### [📊 Monte Carlo Portfolio Optimiser](https://github.com/angh-el/monte-carlo-portfolio-optimiser)
A python toolkit for portfolio optimisation and risk analysis. It combines Black-Litterman portfolio optimisation with Monte Carlo simulations to derrive optimal portfolio allocations and visualise the results.
 
### [📸 PicStagram](https://github.com/angh-el/PicStagram)
PicStagram is a full-stack Instagram clone, built using the MERN stack. The app allows users to upload, like and comment on posts. Other features include user feeds, user profile pages and notifications pages.

### [📮 YouTube File Storage](https://github.com/angh-el/YouTubeFileStorage)
A proof of concept application that aims to use YouTube as an unconventional form of cloud storage. Conclusions of this project highlight the inefficiencies of this approach due to the video files being at least 3 times larger than the original file and the amount of time it takes to convert a file to video format, and vice versa. Additionally, this does not fully adhere to Google's terms of service.
